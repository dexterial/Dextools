Dextools is an Excel addin for primarly unit and functional testing of VBA complex solutions.

It has some extra functionality and some modules are copyrighted by external holders.

Addin is blocked by default by the protected view in Windows, make sure the addin is run in a "safe" location and macros are enabled (at least to get the prompt to enable them).

It is still in prototype stage so use on your own risk.
